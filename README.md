🌐 My Web Development Journey

Hi there 👋 Welcome to my little corner of web development!
This repository is where I collect all my projects, exercises, and experiments as I continue learning and exploring the web.

✨ Why I Started This Repo

I believe the best way to learn is by building things. Every small project or exercise here is a step forward in my journey to becoming a better web developer.

💻 What You’ll Find Here

📝 Exercises → practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics

🎨 Mini Projects → small but fun projects to apply concepts

🚀 Experiments → trying out new ideas and features as I learn


🎯 My Learning Goals

Build clean, responsive, and interactive websites

Get comfortable with JavaScript and later explore frameworks like React.js

Strengthen problem-solving while coding

Create projects that I’m proud to share on my GitHub


🌟 A Note from Me

This repo isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress. Every file here shows my curiosity, effort, and love for learning web development. I’m excited to keep growing and look back one day to see how far I’ve come.
